setuptool-scm for Debian
------------------------

You may have problems packaging upstream software that use this
package for their versioning, since setuptools-scm will not have
access to the git repository when building. You may get errors like:

    LookupError: setuptools-scm was unable to detect version for '/tmp/build-area/gentoo-1.0'.

Debian's Python build toolchain supports setuptools-scm with dh_python
(>= 2.20160609~). Make sure you enable `pybuild` in your
`debian/rules` file, for example:

    %:
        dh $@  --with=python2,sphinxdoc --buildsystem=pybuild

On older versions of dh_python, you can manually override the version
number using the `SETUPTOOLS_SCM_PRETEND_VERSION` variable. For
example, this will pull the version from the upstream PKG-INFO file:

    export SETUPTOOLS_SCM_PRETEND_VERSION=$(shell cat PKG-INFO | sed -n 's/^Version: //p')

This will pull the version from the `debian/changelog` file:

    export SETUPTOOLS_SCM_PRETEND_VERSION=$(shell dpkg-parsechangelog -S version)

setuptools-scm can also be used to generate a file that will contain
version numbers with the `write_to` parameter, as such:

    use_scm_version={
        'write_to': '_version.py',
    },
